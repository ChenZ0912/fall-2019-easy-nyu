# Team Norm

EasyNYU team firmly adheres to [NYU Code of Ethical Conduct](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/code-of-ethical-conduct.html). The team wants to foster an environment which everyone is able to speak freely about his or her opinion and mutual supports. The final decision the team made as a whole, however, will be based on **vote** to avoid any dispute that could delay the development. Also, in order to achieve the high performing team, EasyNYU team will use Slack for all offline discussion and communications, expect a prompt response (being @) no later than **two hours**, and requires **in person participation** in weekly scrum meeting.
